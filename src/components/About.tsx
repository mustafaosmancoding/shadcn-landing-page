                It is a real pain when I see accounting software not being applied correctly by bookkeepers
                because they can offer so much value and insight to a business. 

              </p>
       
              <p> This is why I want to work with a 
                maximum of 10 businesses. With employee size of 2-20. To help them make sure they understand their books,
                and correctly use accounting software such as Sage50 in a way most convieneint to them. I believe the bookkeeping is the 
                most important function of any business. When done accurately, it allows you to safely budget, forecast and acquire, be acquired.
                 </p>

                For any business that is growing and in urgent need of a bookkeeper. Outsourcing to me will be your best bet as it will be cheaper,
                Â£499.00 per month - compared to hiring a full time bookkeeper. Please see below for the companies that I have worked with in the past
                5 years and education background.
